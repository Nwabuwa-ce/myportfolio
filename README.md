Hi my name is Chukwudum and I am a Data Scientist.
I have acquired a couple of certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning
and I look forward to putting my skills to good use in real world situations.
I just began putting together my portfolio to catch the eye of recruiters in the field of data.
## Basic Analysis of Twitter Stock
I downloaded the Twitter stock market dataset in csv format, from Kaggle.com 
I read the csv data into a pandas dataframe and set the "Date" column to become the index.
