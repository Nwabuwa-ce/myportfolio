## Introduction
Hi my name is Chukwudum Nwabuwa and I am a Data Scientist.
I have acquired a couple of certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning
and I look forward to putting my skills to good use in real work situations.
I just began putting together my portfolio in a simple way 
to catch the eye of recruiters in the field of data science/analysis

# Basic Analysis of Twitter Stock

I downloaded the Twitter stock market dataset in csv format, from Kaggle.com, 
then I read the csv data into a Pandas dataframe in a Jupyter Notebook,
and set the "Date" column to become the Index.

### Date as Index

After setting Date as Index, I removed any null values present in the dataset, 
also using the describe() method to check the overview of Dataset statistics.
Then I plotted a graph of Adj Close vs Date, and I observed that there is a drop in price below $20 between 
the period of late 2015 and late 2017, and in 2021 the price rises to over $70.

Thereafter, I plotted a graph of Volume vs Date, and observed that there are two noticeable spikes
in the graph, sometime in 2016 and in early 2022.

Lastly I plotted a graph of 50-day moving average, which 
is a technical indicator that stock traders use in guiding their trading decisions.

The underlying causes of the phenomena observed in the graphs, 
can be put in better perspective when you consider the economic and political 
circumstances surrounding the given periods. These "underlying causes" however,
are beyond the scope of this project.



# Canada Immigration Analysis
This is an analysis of Canada's Immigration data between the years 1980 - 2013. The dataset was sourced 
from the UN data repository.
